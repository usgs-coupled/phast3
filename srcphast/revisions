---------------------------------------
PHAST, Version 1.3.4 (August 30, 2007)
---------------------------------------

    svn 2188: Revised for MPICH2: new comm_world number, 
    rearranged header files.
    
    Fixed bug with print_frequency sometimes failed with
    a zero deltim when using gfortran.


    svn 2088: Now uses hdf5 1.6.5. for both linux and windows.

    svn 2066: Fixed error trap for boundary condition solution that
    was not defined in .chem.dat file.

    svn 2066: Added -start_time to TIME_CONTROL data block.  

    -start_time allows the calculations to begin at a time other than
    zero.

    This feature is useful for restart runs from the end of a
    previous calculation when chemical conditions were saved
    (PRINT_FREQUENCY; -restart). The original .trans.dat file can be
    used (preferably copied to a new name so previous results are not
    overwritten) with the -start_time set to the -end_time of the
    previous run and -end_time extended to a later time. CHEMISTRY_IC
    is modified to define the initial chemistry conditions to be read
    from the restart file of the previous run. For transient flow, the
    head should also be saved in the original run (PRINT_FREQUENCY;
    -save_final_heads) and set as initial conditions for the
    subsequent run (HEAD_IC).  In the subsequent run, boundary
    conditions will be applied according to their time-series
    sequence, even if the changes are earlier than -start_time. No
    time stepping for flow and chemistry will occur until -start_time.

    The -start_time feature is also useful for running simulations by 
    natural year number, say from 1990 to 2005 or by Julian day, when
    the simulation does not start at Julian day zero.

PHAST, Version 1.3.2 (February 1, 2007)
---------------------------------------

    svn 1700: Updated to PHREEQC 2.13.2.

    svn 1641: Fixed bug in velocity interpolation for 1 element
    inactive zone.

---------------------------------------
PHAST, Version 1.3.1 (January 16, 2007)
---------------------------------------

    svn 1595: Updated to PHREEQC 2.13.1.

---------------------------------------
PHAST, Version 1.3.0 (November 3, 2006)
---------------------------------------

    svn 1004: Fixed diffuse_layer bug. Flag was not initialized
    between cells.

    Fixed formatting bug with .O.wel file.
    
    Changed format for TIMCHG in Phast.tmp file. Was fixed format
    now g format. Works better for very small time steps in user 
    units.

    svn 940: Added option to include or exclude prints at end of 
    simulation periods. 

    PRINT_FREQUENCY
    0
	-end_of_period_default t/f

    If set to true, printing will occur at the end of each simulation
    period for all print frequency options that are not equal to zero. If set
    to false, printing will occur only at the interval specified for
    each print frequency option.


    svn 884: Added restart capability.

    Chemical data can be saved and used as initial conditions for
    subsequent runs. The grid should be the same for the restart run
    as for the run that generated the restart file. In general, it is
    assumed that the boundary condition types and media properties
    will be the same for the restart run. However, it should be
    possible to change boundary condition types and media properties
    in subsequent simulations, provided the grid remains the same.

    To save data to a restart file:

    PRINT_FREQUENCY
	-restart 100 yr
    
    In this example, the chemical state of the system will be written
    to file (prefix.restart) every 100 years. At each time of writing,
    the old prefix.restart file will be copied to
    prefix.restart.backup and the new time plane will be written to
    prefix.restart. Only one time plane is saved in prefix.restart and
    one in prefix.restart.backup. You must be careful to save (rename)
    your restart file following a run so that it does not get
    overwritten in subsequent runs.

    To use data from a restart file, use the identifier "restart" in 
    CHEMISTRY_IC in the same way that the identifier "file" can be
    used. 

    CHEMISTRY_IC
    -zone  0 0 0 1000 1000 100
	   -solution restart prefix.restart.save
	   -exchange restart prefix.restart.save
	   -surface restart prefix.restart.save
	   -kinetics restart prefix.restart.save
	   -equilibrium_phases restart prefix.restart.save
	   -gas_phase restart prefix.restart.save

    This example defines all the chemical data for the cells in the
    zone to be taken from the file prefix.restart.save (assuming a
    file prefix.restart was generated and renamed to
    prefix.restart.save). The data for cells in this zone may be
    overwritten by subsequent zone definitions in CHEMISTRY_IC. As is
    always the case, the last zone definition that includes a property
    for a cell is the definition that is used for that property.

    If the last definition for a solution is specified to be from a
    restart file and a solution for that cell is not found in the
    restart file, it is a fatal error. If any other entity (exchange,
    surface, etc) is not found in the restart file for a cell, it a
    warning is printed.

    Prefix, date, current model time, and the number of nodes in each
    coordinate direction (nx, ny, nz) are written as comments at the
    top of the restart file.


    svn 602: 
    Added print of database, input, and output files to .log and
    .O.chem files.

    Removed check for .chem.dat and database files from phastinput.

---------------------------------------
PHAST, Version 1.2 (September 28, 2005)
---------------------------------------

    Added new identifier in SOLUTION_METHOD, 
       -rebalance_fraction f
    where f is a number in the range of 0 to 1. This option applies
    only to the parallel version of phast. After each time step, phast
    evaluates how to optimally rebalance the cells among the
    processors for the chemical calculation. It estimates a number of
    cells to transfer from one processor to the next. The factor f is
    multiplied times the estimated number of cells to obtain the
    actual number of cells transferred. Default is 0.5. 

    Modified PHREEQC to avoid a convergence problem that occurred in
    trying to find the stable phase assemblage in a simulation with
    many, many time steps. Occasionally an exponentiation would
    underflow stopping the simulation. Limited log activities of
    master species to be greater than the smallest machine precision
    exponential number.  Avoids a matherr exception and allows trial
    of additional parameter sets to attempt to solve the system of
    equations.

    Updated to PHREEQC 2.12, which includes Pitzer aqueous model.
    Pitzer funtionality is now available in serial and parallel
    versions, simply use a chemistry database file that includes 
    the PITZER keyword datablock. However, lack of density-dependent 
    flow makes use for brines problematic.

    Major revision of parallel calculation. Now has one routine
    for master process that calculates flow and transport (and 
    chemistry) and one routine for processes that calculate only 
    chemistry. New version has major savings in memory requirements.
    However, the master process may still have large memory 
    requirements.

    Added scaling for flow and transport equations using L-infinity
    norm. A diffusion-only problem failed unless "SOUTION_METHOD; 
    -tolerance x" was extremely small. -tolerance 1e-14 should now 
    be minumum tolerance and same tolerance should apply equally 
    well to all flow and transport. Only rows are scaled; column
    scaling is not used at this time.

    Fixed file opening logic for flow-only calculation. Error 
    messages now printed to screen.

    Fixed convergence test for steady-state with no flow. Avoids 
    error with NAN in calculation of relative flow-rate imbalance.

    Fixed bug with free surface and steady flow. Solution volume
    was not scaled correctly and gave anomalous results for
    cells with small water volumes. Volume of water to amount rock
    was not consistent.


---------------------------------------
PHAST, Version 1.1 (February 14, 2005)
---------------------------------------
      
    Converted to Subversion version control system. Now includes
    latest PHREEQC files automatically. PHAST 1.1 includes files from
    PHREEQC 2.11.

    Fixed file deletion; some temporary files were not deleted at end of run.

    Fixed version number and printing format.

---------------------------------------
PHAST, Version 1.0 (December 20, 2004)
---------------------------------------

(1) Flow and transport data files from version RC3 will not run with
    PHASTINPUT Version 1.0.

    The way that time-series data are defined has changed for boundary
    conditions, wells, rivers, time step, and print frequencies. A
    sequence of data blocks separated by END keywords is no longer
    used to define simulation periods. For boundary conditions, all
    time-varying properties are defined immediately following the
    -zone definition. Time series for wells are defined immediately
    following the -pumping/-injection identifier and following the
    -solution identifier. Time series for a river point are defined by
    -head and -solution following the definition of the location of
    the river point (-point). Time series for time step are defined in
    a single TIME_CONTROL data block. Print frequencies are defined
    for a sequence of times. At each time, print frequencies for
    various files may be redefined.

(2) The handling of the unsaturated zone has changed in free-surface
    simulations. The unsaturated flow is not modeled, so free-surface
    calculations still contain major approximations. However, an
    attempt has been made to avoid some mass-balance errors related to
    rising and falling water tables. The program now separates the
    solids in a cell containing the water table into two reservoirs,
    the saturated and unsaturated reservoirs. As the water table
    rises, solids are transferred from the unsaturated reservoir to
    the saturated reservoir. As the water table falls, solids are
    transferred from the saturated reservoir to the unsaturated
    reservoir. The main deficiency of the current implementation is that
    solids in the unsaturated reservoirs are removed from the
    calculation and do not react with recharge that is, in fact,
    percolating through these solids. There is also no way to view or
    print the masses of solids that are in the unsaturated reservoirs.

(3) Mass-balance accounting for reactions has been added and the
    method for calculating mass-fluxes at boundaries has been changed
    to be consistent with the selected time-weighting scheme for the
    finite-difference equations.

(4) The FLOW_ONLY keyword has been replaced with the SOLUTE_TRANSPORT
    keyword.

(5) Input for rivers has been revised. Each river point location must
    now be defined with the -point identifier. Default properties have
    been eliminated. All properties (width, depth, bed thickness, bed
    hydraulic conductivity, head, and solution composition) are now
    interpolated. All properties must be defined at the end points of
    the river. Additional data may be defined at other river
    points. At the beginning of each simulation period, head and
    solution properties for river points are updated with any new
    values and interpolation for head and solution composition is
    performed.

Working on Cape Cod problem:
	***Item for documentation
	Steady-flow calculation, takes effect even for flow only
		(1) Needs separate time step from transport
			 or automatic time stepper to find steady flow.

	***Two items for documentation:

	(1) Wells are snapped to nodes, which can make a problem asymetric
		Ideally, Ken will allocate flow to more than one cell if
		location is on a cell boundary.
	(2) Flux and leaky zone definitions are snapped to cells? nodes?
		Thus total flux varies with grid definition
	Ideally, flux, leaky, and river bc are accumulated by polygonal
		area.
